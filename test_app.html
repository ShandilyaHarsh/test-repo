            Identity. What is meant by identity? Is it what the people know
            about you or is it what you know about yourself. You might think
            they are one and the same but they are not. We often express
            ourselves the way we want people to see us, and not the real us.
            There is nothing wrong with it, but for one you should always be
            able to differentiate between you and YOU. If this "The short "
            intrigues you, <br />
            GO ON!

          <h2>The Long</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            The place you are born at, the people you are associated with, the
            city you live in, the roads you walk on, the windows you peek
            through- Each and every thing you do is your identity. For so long,
            we have limited the definition of identity to the bare minimum of
            physical self that we have forgotten the real meaning of it. When
            people go through depression and mental issues, they often confuse
            their identity with "null". Their mind underestimates its own value
            and succumbs to the pressure created by the situation. Rather, at
            that time you should understand the real YOU, the You which you have
            hidden from everyone, the you which only YOU know about. You should
            think of the people who care about you, your parents, your friends
            or that stray dog you feed regularly or the ant which feeds on the
            sugar particles which you intentionally drop. We often overlook the
            small things and depress ourselves, but the minute things are the
            ones which when augmented become the strongest force to go against.
            There is no point reading this paragraph if you do notice the small
            things, if you do notice the smile on your mother's face when she
            sees your childhood picture, if you do notice all the little things
            which make a difference. If you don't, you should know the absence
            of those small things won't matter, but YOUR ABSENCE WILL. You do
            make a difference, however small, however big.
